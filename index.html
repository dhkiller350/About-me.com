                I'm a Web-developer and a Cyber-security member and also a music producer. I enjoy working on web development,music,Hacking along with hands on activity.
                My goal is to help those understand me and inspire those that want to do these things and grow from them for future job like machinery, hacking, Military, future web-developer.
                I Have been doing web-development for 5 years and Cyber-security for 4 years started as a black hat then I wanted to change that and become good and help those who needs it.
